### The BLINK! Festival brings together Vienna's german speaking and international improv scene for a packed weekend of improvisational theatre.

The focus is on connecting with other improvisors and playing together, blurring the lines between beginners, experienced players and improv masters.

We'll start the festival with the opening-show on **Friday 12th June**, presenting various areas of improv from different players and groups. On the weekend, throughout the day we will offer a variety of **Playshops** - short, playful workshops on specific topics, hosted by experienced improvisors that you can pick on the spot. Some will be just fun and games, others will explore certain topics in more detail, or even try to put a performance for our evening shows together. Use your sharpened improv skills in one of our **jam-sessions**, where we will encourage you to play scenes with other improvisors – available all day long. In between, **chillax in the cafe** and recharge your batteries with a cool drink and some delicious food, make new friends and then head back to the action! This will all take place within the [Spektakel](https://www.spektakel.wien), so you will always be part of the fun.

This will be the most dynamic festival you've ever participated in - you decide in the moment, what it is going to be, just follow your impulse - your experience of BLINK! will be as unique as an improv scene...but one thing is sure, it'll be over so fast, just like a blink of an eye!
  
We will offer All-Inclusive tickets, One-Day tickets, and Show-Only tickets soon! [Like our page](https://www.facebook.com/BLINK.Improfestival/) or join our mailing list below to make sure you’ll get the early bird discount.

Dear friends!

Unfortunately the last hope to see the BLINK! Festival happen in Vienna on the scheduled date is gone since the recent government announcement - it will not be possible in June 2020.

This is disappointing but understandable, but we will keep you posted if any alternative event can be arranged.

Stay healthy, stay safe and keep doing improv!
